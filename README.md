**Learning the art of short links — a TinyURL clone powered by .NET**

This project is a hands-on learning exercise that explores how modern URL shortening services like TinyURL work under the hood. It covers concepts such as Base62 encoding, SHA-256 hashing, collision handling, and HTTP redirection, all built using clean, idiomatic .NET practices. The goal is not just to recreate a familiar tool, but to understand the design patterns, data storage strategies, and scalability considerations behind it.
